âœ… Just clone, connect to your own Git repo, and start building new features.

 ## What's Already Configured?
âœ… JWT Authentication

âœ… Spring Security

âœ… Spring Data JPA

âœ… Environment-based configuration (application-dev.yml, application-prod.yml)

âœ… Database setup (H2/MySQL/PostgreSQL-ready)

âœ… Secret keys and token configuration (easily customizable)
